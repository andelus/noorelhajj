## Inspiration
HealthCare may take time for transportation to reach the beneficient pilgrim, which increases the risk of crowding.
Furthermore, the difference in languages may affect the communication between the volunteering and the beneficient pilgrim. We found out that there is a high number of interested and skilled pilgrims willing volunteer but have no convenient way to do it especially on the go. Thus, the ability to reduce both time and transport costs while helping pilgrims is very inspiring.

## What it does
Our mobile application relies on a network of skilled volunteer pilgrims to provide the necessary assistance(guide lost pilgrims, make an announcement) for the beneficent ones.

## How we built it
The application started from the beginning with the aim to be cross-platform. With the help of React Native our application can run on any platform iOS, Android and Windows Phone.

## Challenges we ran into
Building mobile applications with React Native comes with implementation caveats. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the simplicity of our application, and the fact that we realized a good portion of in such a short time.

## What we learned
We learned more about the challenges that pilgrims face during Hajj.

## What's next for NoorElHajj
Expanding the network of volunteers in every country to mentor pilgrims before and during Hajj.
